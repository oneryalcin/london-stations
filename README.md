# Udacity Neighbourhood Map Project

Fourth project in Udacity's Full Stack Nanodegree is **Neighbourhood Map Project**. We are asked to create a single page web application usinng **`Knockout.js`** and preffered 3rd party Map application. I decided to use **Google Maps JavaScript Library**

## Application
I'm a regular user of London underground services, therefore I wanted to create a web app, focused on London Train Stations, managed by [TFL](https://tfl.gov.uk) (Transport for London).

Users can:
 - list all train stations along with Zone information. All Stations are displayed on the map.
 - filter stations by typing




## Frameworks
